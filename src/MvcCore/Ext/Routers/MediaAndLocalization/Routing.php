	 * Route current app request by configured routes lists or by query string.
	 * 1. Check if request is targeting any internal action in internal ctrl.
	 * 2. Choose route strategy by request path and existing query string 
	 *    controller and/or action values - strategy by query string or by 
	 *    rewrite routes.
	 * 3. If request is not internal, redirect to possible better URL form by
	 *    configured trailing slash strategy and return `FALSE` for redirection.
	 * 4. Prepare media site version and localization properties and redirect 
	 *    if necessary by media configuration or by localization configuration.
	 * 5. Try to complete current route object by chosen strategy.
	 * 6. If there was not found any rewrite route in rewrite routes strategy, 
	 *    also if there is no localization in request, disallow non localized
	 *    route and re-call localization preparing method and redirect if 
	 *    necessary. It means any request path will be redirected into default 
	 *    localization.
	 * 7. If any current route found and if route contains redirection, do it.
	 * 8. If there is no current route and request is targeting homepage, create
	 *    new empty route by default values if ctrl configuration allows it.
	 * 9. If there is any current route completed, complete self route name by 
	 *    it to generate `self` routes and canonical URL later.
	 * 10.If there is necessary, try to complete canonical URL and if canonical 
	 *    URL is shorter than requested URL, redirect user to shorter version.
	 * If there was necessary to redirect user in routing process, return 
	 * immediately `FALSE` and return from this method. Else continue to next 
	 * step and return `TRUE`. This method is always called from core routing by:
	 * `\MvcCore\Application::Run();` => `\MvcCore\Application::routeRequest();`.
	 * @throws \LogicException Route configuration property is missing.
	 * @throws \InvalidArgumentException Wrong route pattern format.
