	 *   version is different than recognized version (or also for more conditions by 
	 *   configuration), redirect user to proper media website version and route there again.
	 * - Complete before every request from requested path requested localization string
	 *   (language and locale codes) and compare it with session by configuration. If there
	 *   is nothing from previous requests, recognize browser language by `Accept-Language`
	 *   http header, store it in session if anything parsed and continue or redirect by configuration.
	 * - If there is strictly defined `controller` and `action` value in query string,
	 *   route request by given values, add new route and complete new empty
	 *   `\MvcCore\Router::$currentRoute` route with `controller` and `action` values from query string.
	 * - If there is no strictly defined `controller` and `action` value in query string,
	 *   go throught all configured routes and try to find matching route:
	 *   - If there is catched any matching route:
	 *	 - Set up `\MvcCore\Router::$currentRoute`.
	 *	 - Reset `\MvcCore\Request::$params` again with with default route params,
	 *	   with request params itself and with params parsed from matching process.
	 * - If there is no route matching the request and also if the request is targeting homepage
	 *   or there is no route matching the request and also if the request is targeting something
	 *   else and also router is configured to route to default controller and action if no route
	 *   founded, complete `\MvcCore\Router::$currentRoute` with new empty automaticly created route
	 *   targeting default controller and action by configuration in application instance (`Index:Index`)
	 *   and route type create by configured `\MvcCore\Application::$routeClass` class name.
	 * - Return `TRUE` if `\MvcCore\Router::$currentRoute` is route instance or `FALSE` for redirection.
